For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from the website Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined who the Top 10 most popular artists are.
SELECT artist_name AS artist, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined which artist had the song with the longest duration. 
SELECT artist_name AS artist, duration_ms AS time
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP by artist
ORDER by time desc
LIMIT 1;

#Then I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, I showed their average popularity, and labeled them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
